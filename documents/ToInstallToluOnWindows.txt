==============================================
Below is what I had to do to get it working on Linux:

R_2.15.2.tar.gz downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/
ncdf_1.6.3.tar.gz downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ncdf/
netcdf_3.6.3.tar.gz downloaded from: ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/

--------------------------

# What I had to do before installing R version 2.15.2, after downloading and extracting R-2.15.2 from https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/:
sudo yum install readline-devel
sudo yum groups mark install "X Window System"
sudo yum groups mark convert "X Window System"
sudo yum groupinstall "X Window System"
sudo yum install libXt-devel
# Then I could get on with installing it, as instructed in the INSTALL file of the R-2.15.2 root directory:
./configure
make

make check
----------


----------

To get Tolu's R program working:


I had to install netcdf version 3 from ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/  (netcdf-3.6.3.tar.gz), because the R ncdf library required by Tolu's GCMS library doesn't support netcdf version 4. To install, extract it, nagivate into its root directory, and follow the quick instructions in the INSTALL text file. Basically run:

     ./configure
     make check
     sudo make install 
( # to remove/undo?
make distclean
make clean 
)

I had to download an archived version of ncdf (ncdf_1.6.9.tar.gz) from 

https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ncdf/ because the ncdf package supplied by Tolu was built for x86_64-w64-mingw32, and ncdf is no longer in the CRAN repository (has been replaced with ncdf4, which has a different API).

I then tried to install the ncdf package in R using:

sudo ../R-2.15.2/bin/R CMD INSTALL ../ncdf_1.6.9.tar.gz

This failed because: "libnetcdf.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory".

That file did indeed exist, and was located in /usr/local/lib. I needed to add /usr/local/lib to the search path as discussed here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4743233/is-usr-local-lib-searched-for-shared-libraries

The way I ended up doing it was:

cd /etc

less ld.so.conf   # to see what it contains, which was to include everything in the ld.so.conf.d directory

cd ld.so.conf.d

sudo gedit R-x86_64.conf

# then added this on a new line in R-x86_64.conf: /usr/local/lib

# then saved and exited, then ran:

sudo ldconfig -v   # to update the cache

# then cd'd back to my working directory, and re-ran the command:

sudo ../R-2.15.2/bin/R CMD INSTALL ../ncdf_1.6.9.tar.gz
