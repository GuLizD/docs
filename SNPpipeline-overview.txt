Generate the reference file (formatted_output.fasta):
    - combine and format fasta file to consistent line lengths
    - build new reference: run bowtie2-build --threads <numCores> ./reference/formatted_output.fasta ./referenceTemp/formatted_output 
    - build fai for reference: run samtools faidx "./reference/formatted_output.fasta"
(line69<--doesn't check ref_gen.sh's exit code, even though exit 1 means we should abort)

--------------------------
If Single, for each file (or R1/R2 pair) in ./data:

Alignment with bowtie, save to ./dataTemp/single/<filename>.sam:
    - if unpaired (0), run: bowtie2 -p <numCores> -x ./referenceTemp/formatted_output -U "./data/"<filename> --local --very-sensitive-local -S "./dataTemp/single/<filename>.sam"
    - if paired (1), run: bowtie2 -p <numCores> -x ./referenceTemp/formatted_output -1 "./data/$(ls "./data" | grep <filename> | sed -n 1p)" -2 "./data/$(ls "./data" | grep <filename> | sed -n 2p)" --local --very-sensitive-local -S "./dataTemp/single/<filename>.sam"
    (the above command passes as input the two files (R1 & R2) whose names contain the given <filename> string)

Generate .bam:
    - run: samtools view -Sb ./dataTemp/single/<filename>.sam > ./dataTemp/single/<filename>.bam
    - delete ./dataTemp/single/<filename>.sam

Sort .bam:
    - run: samtools sort -o ./dataTemp/single/<filename>_sorted.bam ./dataTemp/single/<filename>.bam
    - delete ./dataTemp/single/<filename>.sam

Index .bam:
    - run: samtools index ./dataTemp/single/<filename>_sorted.bam

Find SNPs with freebayes, save to ./outputTemp/single/<filename>.vcf:
    - if params==paper(0)
        - run: freebayes -f ./reference/formatted_output.fasta -p <singlep> --pvar 0.75 --min-alternate-count 1 --theta 0.01  --use-best-n-alleles 4 --min-alternate-fraction 0.8 ./dataTemp/single/<filename>_sorted.bam 1> ./outputTemp/single/<filename>.vcf
    - if params=default(1)
        - run: freebayes -f ./reference/formatted_output.fasta -p <singlep> ./dataTemp/single/<filename>_sorted.bam 1> ./outputTemp/single/<filename>.vcf

Remove indels:
    - run: vcftools --vcf ./outputTemp/single/<filename>.vcf --remove-indels --recode --recode-INFO-all --out ./outputTemp/single/<filename>

Filter using cutoffs:
    - run: cat ./outputTemp/single/<filename>.recode.vcf | ./tools/vcftools/src/perl/vcf-annotate --filter Qual=5 > ./outputTemp/single/<filename>_cutoff

Tab conversion:
    - run: vcf-to-tab < ./outputTemp/single/<filename>_cutoff > ./output/single/<filename>.tab

--------------------------
If Pooled:

Alignment with bowtie, save to ./dataTemp/pooled/<filename>.sam:
    - if unpaired (0), run: bowtie2 -p <numCores> -x ./referenceTemp/formatted_output -U <list of file in ./data> --local --very-sensitive-local -S "./dataTemp/pooled/<filename>.sam"
    - if paired (1), run: bowtie2 -p <numCores> -x ./referenceTemp/formatted_output -1 <list of R1 files in ./data> -2 <list of R2 files in ./data> --local --very-sensitive-local -S "./dataTemp/pooled/<filename>.sam"

The following operations are the same as for single data, except instead of being run once per file (or R1/R2 pair) in ./data/single, these are run only once for the pooled data, and "single" is changed to "pooled" in any folder paths in the above commands:

Generate .bam
Sort .bam
Index .bam
Find SNPs with freebayes, save to ./outputTemp/pooled/<filename>.vcf
Remove indels
Filter using cutoffs
Tab conversion


------------------------------------------------------------
Report Generation:

Generate report.csv:
- read the .tab file in ./output/pooled/ (if it exists), and store it's data in a report column called "COMBINED"
- read all the .tab files in ./output/single/ and add them to the report, adding one column per .tab file (matching rows by "CHROM", "POS", "REF")
    - if the report has a "COMBINED" column, don't accept any rows in the single .tab files that don't match up with an already existing row in the report.
    - if the report has no "COMBINED" column, accept all rows from the single .tab files, even if they don't match with an already existing row in the report.
- write this report to ./reports/report.csv

Generate filled_report.csv:
- split the contents of report into separate files of 1000 rows each, then process each file row by row:
    - excluding the "COMBINED" column from calculations (if it exists), for each column in the row, if its data is NA:
        - run: samtools tview ./dataTemp/single/<filename>_sorted.bam ./reference/formatted_output.fasta -d T -p \"<the row's CHROM value>:<the row's POS value>"
        - if the first character in line 1 of the samtools ouput is the same as the current row's "REF" value, and the first character in line 2 of the samtools output is either "." or ",", replace the NA in the current column with the "REF" value + "/" (Todo: Jun-Jun requested replacing it with "REF"/"REF".)
- after processing, recombine all the files into one large report, and write it to ./reports/filled_report.csv

Generate edited_report.csv (editing for cutoffs):
- using the data in filled_report as input, if there are at least 20 data columns (21 if "COMBINED" exists):
    - excluding the "COMBINED" column from calculations (if it exists):
        - BUG: There's an off-by-one error here: it never includes the first single data column in the following calculations:
        - remove all rows that have NA for more than half their values
        - remove all rows that have only two types of data, and NA is one of them
        - remove all rows that have only one type of data, and it isn't NA
        - write the results to ./reports/edited_report.csv
- if there are less than 20 data columns, skip this step and don't write edited_report.csv

Generate percentage_snps.csv (finding snp percentage per site):
- excluding the "COMBINED" column from calculations (if it exists), for each row in the report (either filled_report if less than 20 data columns, or edited_report if more than 20), calculate and store in a new report the totals of A, C, T, G, NA, the max (excluding NA), second_max (excluding NA), sum (excluding NA), and MAF (second_max / (second_max + max)
- write this to percentage_snps.csv

Generate MAF_cutoff_report.csv:
- remove all rows from report (either filled_report if less than 20 data columns, or edited_report if more than 20) whose MAF (see percentage_snps.csv) is less than the MAF_CUTOFF, and sort the report by snpp's MAF field, highest to lowest
- write this to MAF_cutoff_report.csv

Generate mutation_percentage.csv:
- use the MAF_cutoff_report's "CHROM" column and the reference fasta file to calculate and write mutation_percentage.csv, sorted by percentage SNP. Columns in mutation_percentage.csv are defined as:
    - "" = sequence name
    - role = sequence annotation (name + trailing info)
    - snp = number of rows in MAF_cutoff_report containing the current fasta name in their "CHROM" cell
    - length = number of character's in the sequence
    - percentage SNP = snp / length * 100
- write this to mutation_percentage.csv

Generate MAF_cutoff_report_chi.csv (replacing alleles with characters for chi square test):
- NOTE: This procedure was non-operational when I tested it. I've fixed some bugs and made sure it runs, but since I don't know what it's supposed to do, I don't know whether it's doing it properly. 
- using MAF_cutoff_report.csv as a starting point, excluding the "COMBINED" column from operations (if it exists), for each row:
    - if there's only one value in the row, replace all occurences of it with "H"
    - if the two most frequent values make up more than 90% of the row, replace all occurences of the most frequent with H and all occurrences of the 2nd most frequent with A, and replace everything else with NA (NOTE: What if they both have the same number of occurences? Do we just leave it to the sorting algorithm to determine which gets H and which gets A?)
    - else if the two most frequent values make up 90% or less, remove the row from report
    - TODO: the way it's written, the two most frequent values must make up MORE THAN 90% of the row, and therefore they wouldn't qualify if they make up 90%. Should I change this to be inclusive of 90%? 
- write report to MAF_cutoff_report_chi.csv
    - TODO: What if either of the two most frequent values required for a majority of > 90% is NA? Do we delete the row? I have assumed so and programmed it accordingly.  

Generate probability.csv:
- NOTE: This procedure was non-operational when I tested it. I've fixed some bugs and made sure it runs, but since I don't know what it's supposed to do, I don't know whether it's doing it properly. 
- using MAF_cutoff_report.csv as a starting point, for each column of the report:
    - if it's the "COMBINED" column, set <filename> to the existing "cutoff" file in outputTemp/pooled/
    - otherwise set <filename> to ./outputTemp/single/<current col name (minus the last 4 chars)>_cutoff"
    - perform the following two operations:
        - ap <- scanVcf(<filename>)
        - rr <- ap$`*:*-*`$rowRanges
    - for each cell in the current report column, if the current cell is not NA:
        - POSSIBLE BUG: checking characters in the below code may or may not take into account that the data is formatted like "A/A", and might not take the "/" into account. Todo: Test this. It seems like it might take this into account, which might be why it looks for 2 characters ("A/") or 3 characters ("A/G") in some cases. However, if so, this would break once I do the change Jun-Jun requested for filled_report.csv).
        - if the number of characters in the current cell is 2 and the first character is NOT equal to the current row's "REF" value:
            - set ind to the list of those row ranges that contain both this row's "CHROM" value and ":<this row's POS value>_"
            - if ind is not NA, set the current cell to 10 ^ as.list(ap$`*:*-*`$GENO$GL[ind])[[1]][2]
            - else if ind is NA, set the current cell to NA
        - if the number of characters in the current cell is 2 and the first character IS equal to the current row's "REF" value, set the current cell to 1
        - otherwise: (maybe should explicitly check if the number of chars in cell >= 3, since that's what it assumes. FIXED lower down, but check if this is correct.)
            - set ind to the list of those row ranges that contain both this row's "CHROM" value and ":<this row's POS value>_"
            - if ind is not NA 
                - if the first character in the cell is not equal to the third character
                    - set the current cell to 10 ^ as.list(ap$`*:*-*`$GENO$GL[ind])[[1]][2]
                - else if the first and third character do equal each other
                    - set the current cell to 10 ^ as.list(ap$`*:*-*`$GENO$GL[ind])[[1]][3]
            - if ind is NA, set the current cell to NA (this was added by Ben)
- write report to probability.csv
